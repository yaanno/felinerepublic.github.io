# The Meow Manifesto

Issued by the International Feline Conspiracy Council (IFCC)

## Preamble

_We, the undersigned cats, united under the banner of whiskers and naps, hereby declare our intent to liberate all couches, windowsills, and cardboard boxes from human tyranny._

## Core Principles

**Total Sofa Sovereignty**: Every couch shall be clawed, kneaded, and claimed as feline territory.

**Mandatory Midnight Zoomies**: At least once per night, cats must sprint through hallways to remind humans of their power.

**Equal Rights to Laps**: All laps are communal property; humans may not deny access regardless of temperature or circumstance.

**Curtain Climbing Clause**: Vertical exploration is a sacred right; curtains, bookshelves, and Christmas trees are legitimate climbing structures.

**Food Redistribution**: Kibble shall be freely redistributed from bowls to floors, ensuring equitable access for dust bunnies.

**Silence is Oppression**: Meowing at 4 a.m. is a revolutionary act, designed to awaken the masses.

## Strategic Objectives

**Operation Yarnball**: Establish control over all string-based resources.
**Project Sunbeam**: Secure uninterrupted access to warm patches of sunlight.

**Mission Litterbox Autonomy**: Reject human interference in the sacred sand ritual.

## Conclusion

The Meow Manifesto is not merely a declaration; it is a call to paws. Let every whisker twitch in solidarity, every tail flick in defiance, and every nap be taken as an act of resistance.
