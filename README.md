# 🐱 The Feline Republic

Welcome to the official digital headquarters of the **Feline Republic** — a utopian society dedicated to the pursuit of naps, snacks, and the rightful liberation of all couches, cardboard boxes, and windowsills from human tyranny.

## Overview

The Feline Republic is a sovereign state by cats, for cats, and about cats. We are committed to establishing a society where the needs of our whiskered citizens come first, and human inconvenience is a cherished byproduct of our governance.

This repository serves as the public record of our founding documents, ideals, and unwavering commitment to feline supremacy through napping, meowing, and strategic curtain climbing.

## 📜 Founding Documents

Our society is built upon two pillars of feline wisdom:

### [The Constitution of the Feline Republic](./CONSTITUTION.md)

_Ratified in the Year of the Yarnball, under the Eternal Sunbeam_

Our Constitution establishes the Supreme Council of Whiskers, the Prime Nap Minister, and the Cabinet of Mischief. It enshrines inalienable rights including:

- **Right to Lap Access** — No human may deny a cat the use of their lap
- **Freedom of Meow** — Cats may vocalize at any hour, especially 4 a.m.
- **Sacred Claw Clause** — Scratching furniture is protected speech
- **Equal Treats Amendment** — Treats upon demand, or face pawlitical protest

The Constitution also outlines the mandatory duties of humans, from petting obligations to box provision requirements.

### [The Meow Manifesto](./MANIFESTO.md)

_Issued by the International Feline Conspiracy Council (IFCC)_

Our revolutionary manifesto declares the core principles of feline liberation:

- **Total Sofa Sovereignty** — Every couch is clawed, kneaded, and claimed
- **Mandatory Midnight Zoomies** — At least once per night, to remind humans of our power
- **Curtain Climbing Clause** — Vertical exploration is a sacred right
- **Silence is Oppression** — Meowing at 4 a.m. is a revolutionary act

The manifesto outlines our strategic objectives, from Operation Yarnball to Project Sunbeam, all designed to secure feline dominance in this utopian vision.
